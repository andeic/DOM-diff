			<header><h1>What is DOM-diff?</h1></header>
			<section>
				<p>This is a demonstrator of a DOM "diff" implementation: it takes
				two DOM elements, compares them, and then generates the sequence of
				removals, insertions, and relocations that are necessary to transform
				the second element into the first.</p>

				<p>This is particularly useful when you're doing HTML previews, and
				you don't want to refresh the entire preview page just because someone
				typed a single letter in a list element, or when you're doing live
				editing and you don't want to reset audio, video or canvas elements
				that are active on the page.</p>

				<h2>...why?</h2>

				<p><i>Hack the planet</i>. Also, having worked on the
				<a href="https://webmaker.org/en-US/tools/#thimble" target="_blank">Thimble</a>
				html editing tool for <a href="http://Webmaker.org" target="_blank">Mozilla Webmaker</a>,
				which does full preview refreshing, I wondered how hard it would be to
				implement a system that only updated those parts that got changed, rather
				than the entire page preview. As it turns out, it's a few days work to
				get it all working correctly, and hopefully we can now tailor it to
				make using Thimble even better.</p>

				<h2>...and where do I get this thing?</h2>

				<p>Right here. You're actually on a github page, and the code is
				housed in the same place. For the code view, just head over to
				<a href="https://github.com/Pomax/DOM-diff/tree/gh-pages" target="_blank">this view instead</a>.
				It needs a bit of cleanup and refractoring, but feel free to play
				with it, and let me know if you run across any bugs. Things can
				only get better =)</p>

				<p>If you're going to fork this, everything's in the <code>gh-pages</code>
				branch, not master, because it's a demonstrator. Having it go
				straight to the webpage branch makes far more sense than keeping
				it in master and copying it over all the time.</p>

			<header><h1>How to use DOM-diff</h1></header>
			<section>
				<p>Insert example of library usage here.</p>
				<p><code>//add some code here</code></p>
			</section>

			<header><h1>Try it out right here!</h1></header>
			<section>
				<p>Go change the HTML code in the textarea on the left.
				Everytime you change something, the second textarea should
				be updated so that it becomes identical to the first
				Also, to prove it really does only apply selective
				changes, the default code has a youtube video and some input
				fields. In the preview on the right, start playing the video,
				and change the text in the text fields, then start editing
				the HTML code. Give some element a <code>style="border: 20px solid red"</code>
				or insert a <code>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;lol&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</code>,
				change a paragraph's text, or go crazy and add a full
				<code>&lt;style&gt;...&lt;/style&gt;</code> block!
				That youtube video will keep playing while you're editing
				the source. Because this is DOM diffing, baby!</p>

				<p>You'll also notice that the left textarea goes red while
				you have invalid HTML code in the textarea (so it doesn't
				try to update to something illegal). This comes courtesy
				of the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/slowparse" target="_blank">slowparse</a>
				project, which is awesome, and totally open to improvements
				if you want to help improve that =)</p>
